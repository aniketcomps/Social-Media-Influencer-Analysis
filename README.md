# Social-Media-Influencer-Analysis

### Goal

Identify which Twitter users are most influential in Austin city community, factors that drive influence and quantify financial benefit of influencer marketing.

    "consumer_secret": "<<enter your consumer_secret here>>",
    "bearer_token":"<<enter your bearer_token here>>",
    "access_token":"<<enter your access_token here>>",

### Data Sources

### For part-1:
Kaggle network dataset - [Influencers in Social Networks](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-who-is-more-influential-in-a-social-network) 

### For part-2:
Tweets about Austin city from Twitter API

### Approach

#### Part-1

* Feature Engineer by transformations and network features (degree, centrality and closeness)
* Evaluate models to identify influencers from the Kaggle dataset. We found Logistic Regression with LASSO penality to work best.
* Note important factors and their polarity that contribute to influence
* Quantify financial benefit of the model through cumulative lift in profits from influencer marketing

#### Part-2

* Fetch 5000 tweets about Austin city through Twitter API
* Visualize network of users based on retweets. This identifies influencers visually.
* Calculate important factors of influence identified from Part-1 and network features (degree, centrality and closeness)
* Scale these factors using weights from Part-1's Logistic Regression model
* Calculate influence score by summing these scaled influence factors
* Users with high influence scores are our Austin city influencers on Twitter
